# pseudocu Interpreter

A pseudocode interpreter written in Rust. This project implements an interpreter for a pseudocode-like language designed to be intuitive and educational.

## Overview

pseudocu is an interpreter that allows writing and executing code in a pseudocode-like syntax. The language is designed to be easy to read and write, making it ideal for learning programming concepts, algorithm design, and quick scripting.

The interpreter is being developed in Rust, focusing on simplicity, clarity, and educational value.

## Language Specification

The complete language grammar is defined in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) in the file:

```
BNF.txt
```

This file contains the formal specification of the pseudocu language syntax and structure.

## Roadmap

- [x] Repository initialization
- [x] Basic BNF grammar definition
- [ ] Lexer implementation
- [ ] Parser implementation
- [ ] AST definition
- [ ] Interpreter core
